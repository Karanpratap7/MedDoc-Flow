- 🤖 **AI-Powered Chat Interface**: Ask questions about your documents using natural language
- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Advanced document retrieval using FAISS vector embeddings
- 💬 **Interactive UI**: Clean, medical-themed interface with real-time chat experience
- 🧠 **Context-Aware Responses**: AI provides answers based on your uploaded documents
- ⚡ **Fast Processing**: Efficient text chunking and vector indexing for quick responses
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karanpratap7/MedDoc-Flow.git
   cd MedDoc-Flow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirments.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your API key**
   - Create or update `app/config.py` with your Euri AI API key:
   ```python
   EURI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
   - Start uploading your medical documents!

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Upload Documents
- Use the sidebar to upload one or more PDF documents
- Supported formats: PDF files containing medical text

### 2. Process Documents
- Click "⚙️ Process Documents" to analyze and index your files
- The system will extract text and create searchable embeddings

### 3. Start Chatting
- Use the chat interface to ask questions about your documents
- Examples:
  - "What are the main symptoms described in patient 1?"
  - "Summarize the treatment recommendations"
  - "What medications were prescribed?"

### 4. Get AI Responses
- Receive contextual answers based on your uploaded documents
- The AI will clearly indicate if information is not available in your documents
